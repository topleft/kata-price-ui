## Price UI

My latest learning project is taking UI designs I find on the internet and turning them into functioning React apps. I search for attractive designs with included sketch files. [dribble](https://dribbble.com/) is a great place for design resources and web inspiration. Looking for a clean, simple UI that included some user interaction I found [Sandeep Kasundra's](https://dribbble.com/sandeepkasundra) [Pricing example](https://dribbble.com/shots/5079559-Pricing).

Thanks Sandeep, great stuff!

## Responsive and tested! (Cypress end to end tests soon to come)

Have a look at the code and let me know what you think. Thanks.
