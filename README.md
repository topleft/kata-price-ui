## UI Kata

This is part of my UI Kata learning initiative. I find sketch files of UI's on the internet and code them up focusing on 5 things:
 - React component structure
 - High quality CSS
 - Responsiveness (mobile first)
 - Component testing
 - Accessability

## Design

Looking for a clean, simple UI that included some user interaction I found [Sandeep Kasundra's](https://dribbble.com/sandeepkasundra) [Pricing example](https://dribbble.com/shots/5079559-Pricing).

Thanks Sandeep, great stuff!



## Responsive and tested! (Cypress end to end tests soon to come)

Have a look at the code and let me know what you think. Thanks.
